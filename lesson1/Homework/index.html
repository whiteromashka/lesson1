<h3 id="bs" style="background: green">Bart Simpson</h3>

<p>
    Bart is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child. He is the
    only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo",
    after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical
    Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the
    Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.

<h3 id="ms" style="background: royalblue">Marge Simpson</h3>

<p>
    Marge, who calls Bart her "special little guy", is much more caring, understanding and nurturing than Homer, but she
    also refers to Bart as "a handful" and is often embarrassed by his antics.

<h3 id="hs" style="background: brown">Homer Sipson</h3>
<p>
    Due to Bart's mischievousness and rebelliousness in addition to Homer's often uncaring and incompetent behavior, the
    two have a turbulent relationship. Bart will often address Homer by his given name instead of "Dad" (when he was a
    baby, this was because other adults would refer to him as this), while Homer in turn often refers to him as "the
    boy".
